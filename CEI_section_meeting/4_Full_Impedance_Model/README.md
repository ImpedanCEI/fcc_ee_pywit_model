*A repository containing all elements of the FCC-ee impedance wake model.*

---

## 🌀 Overview

This repository contains the **Impedance/Wake Model** for the FCC-ee project.  
Here, you will find all the necessary elements, scripts, and data to work with the model.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ImpedanCEI/fcc_ee_IW_model
```

Once cloned, navigate into the repository folder:

```bash
cd fcc_ee_IW_model
```

## 📁 Contents


- **Elements** – All impedance wake model elements are collected here:
  - **BPMs** – 10,000 evaluated with CST.
  - **RF cavities** – 132 single-cell 400 MHz RF cavities.
  - **Bellows** – Bellows section models.
  - **Collimators** – 41 collimators; Geometrical (CST) and RW (IW2D) contributions considered.
  - **Beam pipe** – Circular copper cross-section (radius 30 mm) coated with a 150 nm NEG layer; evaluated with IW2D + numerical form factor for both driving and detuning impedance/wake, considering the realistic vacuum chamber shape.
  - **Tapers** – 33 taper elements.
- **Scripts** – Utilities for running and analyzing simulations.
- **Images** – Contribution plots.
- **Output** – Output files for your workflow.
